# About Me:

I am a undergraduate student at Michigan State University studying biochemistry and molecular biology. I am an undergraduate research assistant in the Petroff Lab and a part of the physics for biologists teaching team. After graduation, I would like to study medicine. Apart from academics, I enjoy traveling the world and water sports.
